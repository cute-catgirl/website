I'm scared for the future. I don't even live in the US but things are [only](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/alberta-tables-bills-on-transgender-youth-health-care-students-pronouns-opt-in-sex-education-1.7370006) [getting](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-transgender-danielle-smith-acac-mount-royal-1.7370620) [worse](https://newsinteractives.cbc.ca/elections/poll-tracker/canada/) here too.

I don't know what to do right now. I don't think any of us do. I would be lying if I said that I had hope right now.

But what I do know is that I will never give up. We will never give up. We will keep fighting until every single person, regardless of race, gender, wealth, or any other factors has the rights they deserve.

There's a lot of hate in the world, and I'm not sure if our love can drown it out. Either way, we sure as hell will try.

Trans rights. Now and forever. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
